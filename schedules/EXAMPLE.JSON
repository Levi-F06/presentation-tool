    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Levi Flanagan",
      "talkName": "never used JSON before",
      "time": "17:00",
    },

  ]
}

id names will match with the images sent, so if speaker 1 is in room2 the image will be named
images/room2/1.png so ensure that the files match the id number of speaker

This example can be copy and pasted into each room JSON file
